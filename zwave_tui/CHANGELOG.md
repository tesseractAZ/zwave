# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-10

Initial skeleton: a read-only Z-Wave mesh health TUI served over telnet
(`:2324`) and the Home Assistant sidebar (Ingress `/console`).

- Full Home Assistant add-on scaffold — `config.yaml` / `build.yaml` /
  `repository.yaml` / `Dockerfile` / s6 `run` service / AppArmor — building a
  prebuilt multi-arch GHCR image, `init: false`, Ingress-ready.
- HA Core WebSocket client (SUPERVISOR_TOKEN auth) with a subscription event
  demux and auto-reconnect.
- Z-Wave data layer: `zwave_js` entry-id auto-discovery, device + entity
  registry join, and a `network_status` roster poll.
- Telnet TUI + xterm.js browser console sharing one TUI session and data
  provider, with an anti-flicker draw loop.
- Overview node-list home sorted worst-health-first, over a composite health
  model (SNR margin over the live noise floor, Long-Range aware, battery as a
  separate lane, hard gates for dead/unknown/asleep).
- Read-only by default: mutating actions are gated off
  (`write_actions_enabled` defaults false); ping is wired but gated.

# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-11

Live statistics + the full six-screen interface. The health scores now reflect
real RF conditions instead of a uniform placeholder.

- **Live node + controller statistics**: subscribes to
  `zwave_js/subscribe_node_statistics` and `subscribe_controller_statistics`.
  Subscribing delivers each node's current stats immediately (no pinging), so
  the Overview populates within seconds. Fills the Margin / Hop / Rate / Seen
  columns with real RSSI, route, data-rate, and last-seen data — and the health
  score now spreads across the mesh (e.g. a weak, multi-hop node grades below a
  strong direct one) instead of every node reading the same.
- **Detail** screen: full per-node dossier — identity, security, live link
  (RTT / RSSI / SNR margin / drop%), the LWR + NLWR route chains with per-hop
  RSSI and data rate, TX/RX counters, and power source.
- **Controller** screen: node-1 identity + roles, live traffic counters, and an
  A–F network-health histogram.
- **Topology** screen: nodes grouped by hop count with their repeater chains,
  plus a repeater-load (single-point-of-failure) tally.
- **Signal Heatmap** screen: nodes by area, cells graded by SNR margin,
  worst-area-first.
- **Event & Command Log** screen: node status changes and mesh re-routing,
  severity-coloured.
- Correct field mapping under the hood: HA's snake_case stat fields → the
  internal model, the misspelled `timout_response` controller key, and route
  `repeaters` given as HA device_ids resolved back to Z-Wave node ids.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-10

Initial skeleton: a read-only Z-Wave mesh health TUI served over telnet
(`:2324`) and the Home Assistant sidebar (Ingress `/console`).

- Full Home Assistant add-on scaffold — `config.yaml` / `build.yaml` /
  `repository.yaml` / `Dockerfile` / s6 `run` service / AppArmor — building a
  prebuilt multi-arch GHCR image, `init: false`, Ingress-ready.
- HA Core WebSocket client (SUPERVISOR_TOKEN auth) with a subscription event
  demux and auto-reconnect.
- Z-Wave data layer: `zwave_js` entry-id auto-discovery, device + entity
  registry join, and a `network_status` roster poll.
- Telnet TUI + xterm.js browser console sharing one TUI session and data
  provider, with an anti-flicker draw loop.
- Overview node-list home sorted worst-health-first, over a composite health
  model (SNR margin over the live noise floor, Long-Range aware, battery as a
  separate lane, hard gates for dead/unknown/asleep).
- Read-only by default: mutating actions are gated off
  (`write_actions_enabled` defaults false); ping is wired but gated.
- Optional **login gate** for direct (non-ingress) access: users + passwords
  set in the add-on config, plaintext or `scrypt:` hashes. HA-sidebar access is
  trusted (already HA-authenticated). Hardened after an adversarial review —
  async scrypt (never blocks the event loop), startup normalization to scrypt
  (constant-cost verify, no username enumeration), a per-client backoff that
  survives reconnects, and a telnet connection cap. Fails closed when enabled
  with no users configured.
- Portable by design: no controller/mesh specifics hard-coded — the entry id is
  auto-discovered and the roster comes from the registries, so it runs on any
  Home Assistant install with the Z-Wave JS integration.

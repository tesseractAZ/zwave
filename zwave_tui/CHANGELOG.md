# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-10

Initial skeleton: a read-only Z-Wave mesh health TUI served over telnet
(`:2324`) and the Home Assistant sidebar (Ingress `/console`).

- Full Home Assistant add-on scaffold — `config.yaml` / `build.yaml` /
  `repository.yaml` / `Dockerfile` / s6 `run` service / AppArmor — building a
  prebuilt multi-arch GHCR image, `init: false`, Ingress-ready.
- HA Core WebSocket client (SUPERVISOR_TOKEN auth) with a subscription event
  demux and auto-reconnect.
- Z-Wave data layer: `zwave_js` entry-id auto-discovery, device + entity
  registry join, and a `network_status` roster poll.
- Telnet TUI + xterm.js browser console sharing one TUI session and data
  provider, with an anti-flicker draw loop.
- Overview node-list home sorted worst-health-first, over a composite health
  model (SNR margin over the live noise floor, Long-Range aware, battery as a
  separate lane, hard gates for dead/unknown/asleep).
- Read-only by default: mutating actions are gated off
  (`write_actions_enabled` defaults false); ping is wired but gated.
- Optional **login gate** for direct (non-ingress) access: users + passwords
  set in the add-on config, plaintext or `scrypt:` hashes. HA-sidebar access is
  trusted (already HA-authenticated). Hardened after an adversarial review —
  async scrypt (never blocks the event loop), startup normalization to scrypt
  (constant-cost verify, no username enumeration), a per-client backoff that
  survives reconnects, and a telnet connection cap. Fails closed when enabled
  with no users configured.
- Portable by design: no controller/mesh specifics hard-coded — the entry id is
  auto-discovered and the roster comes from the registries, so it runs on any
  Home Assistant install with the Z-Wave JS integration.
